# Media Automation Plugin (Partial Code)

## Description
This repository contains partial code for a WordPress plugin designed for automating the management of media posts. **Note**: This code is for informational purposes only and does not represent a complete plugin. The provided code should be reviewed and adapted before implementation in a production environment.

## Features
The plugin includes the following functionalities:

1. **Media Management Interface**:
   - A custom table (`MediaTable`) displaying media posts with relevant details such as title, post ID, publication status, and language.
   - Search and filter capabilities for media posts.
   - Integration with WordPress' `WP_List_Table` for creating custom admin tables.

2. **Automation with Cronjobs**:
   - Two cronjobs are configured to automatically unpublish media posts older than a specified period (5 years for non-gated content and 2 years for gated content).
   - Status checks and logs are included to monitor the execution of cronjobs and display the last and next scheduled runs.

3. **Background Processing**:
   - Integration with a background process to handle batch processing of media posts asynchronously, ensuring server performance is maintained during large-scale operations.
   - Background processing is initiated with a custom PHP class (`MediaBackgroundProcess`) that pushes tasks to the queue and dispatches them.

4. **User Interface for Cronjob Management**:
   - Admin pages to enable or disable cronjobs and set start dates.
   - Visual indicators for the activation status of each cronjob.
   - Logs that display the cronjob execution history, with an option to clear logs.

5. **Form Integration**:
   - Integration with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for managing post exclusions directly from the WordPress admin.

## How to Use
This code is part of a larger plugin project and is not meant for standalone use. To use this code:

1. Ensure that **ACF Pro** is installed and activated for the ACF-related forms and field groups.
2. Integrate the code into a custom plugin or a theme's `functions.php` for testing and development purposes.
3. Review and modify the code to meet your specific project requirements, including any additional security or customization needs.

## Important Notes
- The code provided is for **educational and informational purposes**. It is not a complete or fully functional plugin.
- Ensure proper testing and validation in a development environment before deploying any code changes to a live site.
- This code includes references to the `WP_List_Table`, `ACF`, and custom classes such as `MediaBackgroundProcess`, which should be implemented or included in the full plugin.
